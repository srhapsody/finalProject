# Minseok's CCTV Project!

This is a project for the Final Assignment of OpenSource Software of Handong Global University led by Prof. W.H.Lee. 


# Purpose

Many students of HGU live in private houses where security is not **guranteed.** One can enter house easily as most of the students have easy passwords on their door lock. This cctv project is meant for those who have weak security in their houses. With the help of just raspberrypi and camera, we can install cctv at our home.

## What It Can Do ?

Before leaving the house, user can start recording the video and check it out when user returns back home.

## How to Use It ?

Make directory in /home/pi named picam, where all the videos and images will be stored. Before leaving the house, run python programmes according to the time that you will be out for.
> $mkdir /home/pi/picam</br>
> $python cctvFor(user_choice).py or</br>
> $python picam.py

## Further Development
Curretly, picam.py is used when user wants to capture image when theire is motion detected in camera. I want to impliment it and also use face recognition.
